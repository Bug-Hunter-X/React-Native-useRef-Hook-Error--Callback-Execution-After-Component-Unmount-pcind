This error occurs when using the `useRef` hook in React Native with a component that is unmounted before the callback function in `useRef` is executed.  This typically happens when you have asynchronous operations triggered within a component that continues to execute even after the component is unmounted. For example, a network request started just before the component unmounts may complete later, attempting to update the unmounted component and resulting in the error.
