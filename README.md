# React Native useRef Hook Error: Callback Execution After Component Unmount

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native involving the `useRef` hook: callbacks within `useRef` executing after the component has unmounted. This can lead to memory leaks and unexpected behavior.

## The Problem
The `useRef` hook's primary purpose is to create mutable variables that persist across renders. However, if you trigger an asynchronous operation (like a network request) within a `useRef` callback and the component unmounts before the callback completes, it might still attempt to update the unmounted component, resulting in errors.

## The Solution
The solution is to implement a cleanup mechanism.  Check component mounting status and cancel asynchronous operations in a `useEffect` hook's cleanup function.
